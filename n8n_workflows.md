# ⚡ Nzamy — n8n Automation Workflows (Phase 4)

> **STATUS (2026-06-28):** Superseded by `n8n_master_guide_latest.md` (action plan) + `n8n/README.md` (integration contract). Kept as a technical reference. The Next.js trigger layer is now built: `POST /api/v1/n8n/trigger` + `src/lib/n8n/payload.ts` + `src/lib/events.ts` (namespaced events). Importable workflow JSON templates live at `n8n/workflows/`.

---

> **Purpose**: All 18 n8n workflows + 9 email templates + WhatsApp integration.
> Each workflow is described as a simple flow, then broken into implementation checkboxes.
> We will build these **one by one** in order of priority.
